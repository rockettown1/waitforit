## Something to Look at

Quick single page app for students to look at while waiting for sessions to start or during breaks.

Instructor to share this screen so everyone knows how long until something happens!
The button to open the sidebar is hidden in the top left corner and will display on hover.

Set the title, a little message, background image (optional) and the timer.
This also plays videos (loops through a handful of Code Nation youtube vids) - this was briefly tested using Zoom as it has the ability to share a computers sound directly and optimise for screen sharing videos. If you don't think the platform you're teaching on has the ability optimise this, then choose not to display the video component.

Also, remember to always go retro.

If you have any ideas for additional features just make a pull request.
